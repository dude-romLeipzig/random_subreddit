# Random Subreddit Generator

Neon-retro style chaos for your browser â€” discover random corners of Reddit.

Originally, I tried Redditâ€™s API for true randomness, but that didnâ€™t quite work.

Now, the app generates a random two-letter string, searches Reddit, and picks a subreddit at random.

Next up: numbers and special characters for even wilder randomness.

A fun little web app to send you down unknown rabbit holes of Reddit lore. ðŸŽ®
